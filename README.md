# GLVisualize

GLVisualize is an interactive 2D/3D visualization library completely written in OpenGL and Julia.

# Documentation

# Installation

Here is a script adding the packages and checking out the correct branches:

```Julia
Pkg.add("GLVisualize")
Pkg.checkout("GLAbstraction", "sd/nextÂ²")
Pkg.checkout("GLVisualize", "next2")
Pkg.checkout("GLWindow", "sd/rebuild")
Pkg.checkout("GeometryTypes")
Pkg.checkout("FixedSizeArrays")
Pkg.checkout("MeshIO")
```


Known problems:
- On linux, particles don't seem to work whenever you don't pass `color=texture_buffer(Vector{RGBA{Float32}})` to the `visualize` keyword arguments (assigning every particle a seperate color). This is fixed on branch `next2`
- boundingboxes are not always correct (fixed on `next2`)
- On Mac OS, you need to make sure that Homebrew.jl works correctly, which was not the case on some tested machines (needed to checkout master and then rebuild)
- GLFW needs `cmake` and `xorg-dev` `libglu1-mesa-dev` on linux (can be installed via `sudo apt-get install xorg-dev libglu1-mesa-dev`).
- VideoIO and FreeType seem to be also problematic on some platforms. There isn't a fix for all situations. If these package fail, try `Pk.update();Pkg.build("FailedPackage")`.If this still fails, report an issue on Github!

Try `Pkg.test("GLVisualize")` to see if things work! If things are working, you should see (after some delay for compilation) an animation pop up in a window with a spiral of cubes moving over a background of several other images and visualizations.
Close the window when you tire of watching it, and you should see a "tests passed" message.
